/**
 * A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
	这是一个对持有的元素优先处理的设计的集合(队列先进先出)
 * Besides basic {@link java.util.Collection Collection} operations,
	除了Collection的基本操作，
 * queues provide additional insertion, extraction, and inspection operations.
	queues 提供了额外的 插入，抽取(取出) 和 检查操作。
 * Each of these methods exists in two forms: one throws
 * an exception if the operation fails, the other returns a special
 * value (either <tt>null</tt> or <tt>false</tt>, depending on the
 * operation).  The latter form of the insert operation is designed
 * specifically for use with capacity-restricted <tt>Queue</tt>
 * implementations; in most implementations, insert operations cannot
 * fail.
	这些方法都有两种形式：一种是如果操作失败，抛出异常；另一种返回特殊值(NULL值或者false，取决于操作)
	插入操作返回null或者false是专门为 有容量限制的queue 设计的。
 *
 * <p>
 * <table BORDER CELLPADDING=3 CELLSPACING=1>
 *  <tr>
 *    <td></td>
 *    <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Throws exception</em></td>		抛出异常
 *    <td ALIGN=CENTER><em>Returns special value</em></td>	返回特殊值
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *    <td><b>Insert</b></td>	插入操作
 *    <td>{@link #add add(e)}</td>
 *    <td>{@link #offer offer(e)}</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *    <td><b>Remove</b></td>	移除操作
 *    <td>{@link #remove remove()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link #poll poll()}</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *    <td><b>Examine</b></td>	检查/访问操作
 *    <td>{@link #element element()}</td>
 *    <td>{@link #peek peek()}</td>
 *  </tr>

 * <p>Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a
 * FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner.  Among the exceptions are
 * priority queues, which order elements according to a supplied
 * comparator, or the elements' natural ordering, and LIFO queues (or
 * stacks) which order the elements LIFO (last-in-first-out).
 * Whatever the ordering used, the <em>head</em> of the queue is that
 * element which would be removed by a call to {@link #remove() } or
 * {@link #poll()}.  In a FIFO queue, all new elements are inserted at
 * the <em> tail</em> of the queue. Other kinds of queues may use
 * different placement rules.  Every <tt>Queue</tt> implementation
 * must specify its ordering properties.
	Queues通常，但不是一定的，按照先进先出的方式排列元素。
	优先队列是列外的--比如根据提供的比较器排序，或者元素自然排序，或者后进先出(栈)。
	不管用那种排序方式，remove或者poll移除方法都会操作queue的头元素。
	在先进先出队列，所有新元素都会插入在队列尾部。其他类型队列可能采用不同的放置规则。
	每个Queue的实现必须制定它的排序属性。
 *
 * <p>The {@link #offer offer} method inserts an element if possible,
 * otherwise returning <tt>false</tt>.  This differs from the {@link
 * java.util.Collection#add Collection.add} method, which can fail to
 * add an element only by throwing an unchecked exception.  The
 * <tt>offer</tt> method is designed for use when failure is a normal,
 * rather than exceptional occurrence, for example, in fixed-capacity
 * (or &quot;bounded&quot;) queues.
	offer方法设计是为了当失败是正常的而不是有以外的发生，例如固定容量的queue插入超过了界限。
	此时返回false，而不抛出异常。
	
	
 *
 * <p>The {@link #remove()} and {@link #poll()} methods remove and
 * return the head of the queue.
 * Exactly which element is removed from the queue is a
 * function of the queue's ordering policy, which differs from
 * implementation to implementation. The <tt>remove()</tt> and
 * <tt>poll()</tt> methods differ only in their behavior when the
 * queue is empty: the <tt>remove()</tt> method throws an exception,
 * while the <tt>poll()</tt> method returns <tt>null</tt>.
 *
 * <p>The {@link #element()} and {@link #peek()} methods return, but do
 * not remove, the head of the queue.
 *
 * <p>The <tt>Queue</tt> interface does not define the <i>blocking queue
 * methods</i>, which are common in concurrent programming.  These methods,
 * which wait for elements to appear or for space to become available, are
 * defined in the {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue} interface, which
 * extends this interface.
 *
 * <p><tt>Queue</tt> implementations generally do not allow insertion
 * of <tt>null</tt> elements, although some implementations, such as
 * {@link LinkedList}, do not prohibit insertion of <tt>null</tt>.
 * Even in the implementations that permit it, <tt>null</tt> should
 * not be inserted into a <tt>Queue</tt>, as <tt>null</tt> is also
 * used as a special return value by the <tt>poll</tt> method to
 * indicate that the queue contains no elements.
 *
 * <p><tt>Queue</tt> implementations generally do not define
 * element-based versions of methods <tt>equals</tt> and
 * <tt>hashCode</tt> but instead inherit the identity based versions
 * from class <tt>Object</tt>, because element-based equality is not
 * always well-defined for queues with the same elements but different
 * ordering properties.
